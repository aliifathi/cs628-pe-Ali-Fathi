Cities Application - README Overview

The Cities Application is a web application built with React that lets users interact with data about different cities. The app provides a seamless and interactive experience for adding, viewing, and exploring city details thanks to its modern web development tools, which include React Router DOM for routing and React Context API for state management.

Three main features make up the application's structure:

1. Cities List: Shows a list of cities with clickable links for each city. Users are redirected to a specific details page upon selecting a city. This functionality efficiently manages navigation by utilizing the `Link` and `Route` components of React Router.

2. Add City: Offers a form for users to enter information about a new city, such as its name, population, nationality, and description. The app updates after the form is submitted.

3. City Details: Provides comprehensive details on a chosen city. The application uses the `useParams` hook from React Router to access the city's unique ID when a user clicks on a city name from the list. This guarantees that only pertinent data for that city is shown.

React Router DO is used by the application to manage dynamic routing and navigation, guaranteeing a smooth user experience free from page reloads. The city list can be accessed and updated across several components thanks to the Context API, which is used for global state management.

Basic CSS is used to style the program, resulting in a neat and intuitive user experience. Because of its modular design, it is simple to scale or link with backend APIs for managing data in real time. This project is a great way to learn about the component-based architecture, state management, and routing of React.
